# RPGHeroes
This was an assignment of Noroff .NET Fullstack Bootcamp. In this assignment we made Console Application where user can create a Hero of four type. User
can equip specific type of Weapon and Armor for Hero. User can check how much damage hero can do according attributes. User can also level up Hero and
displays Hero's information. Console will throw Custom Exceptions if user tries to equip wrong type of Weapon or Armor.

This project was made completely by C# and tested with XUnit.
